A WIP manual Archipelago world for the board game Mage Knight's scenario Solo Conquest.



Taking notes about the logical minimum Fame generated from each tile:
Orcs: 2
Keep: 3
Mage Tower: 4
Brown: 4
White: 7
Dragon: 7

Countryside 1: 2
Countryside 2: 2
Countryside 3: 3
4: 6 (green + purple)
5: 6 (green + purple (monestery))
6: 6 (green + monster den)
7: 10 (green + purple + brown (dungeon))
8: 2? (green + ruins)
9: 12 (grey + purple + dungeon)
10: 8? (grey + monster den + ruins)
11: 6? (green + purple + ruins)

Core:
1: 19 (monestery + spawning grounds + tomb)
2: 11? (purple + ruins + draconum)
3: 11? (purple + ruins + tomb)
4: 11? (grey + ruins + draconum)


5: 26 (green x2 + 15/22 city)
6: 33 (monestery + draconum + 15/22 city)
7: 43 (grey + spawning grounds + draconum + 17/24 city)
8: 36? (ruins + draconum x2 + 15/22 city)



I think Level 4 in the logic should be level 5, etc. and I skipped level 4 requiring 15 fame.



Levels expected per enemy type:
Green: 1
Grey: 1
Purple: 2
Monestery: 3
Monster Den: 2
Dungeon: 3
Spawning Grounds: 5
Draconum: 5
Tomb: 6
Victory: 8
